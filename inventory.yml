# Primary server that can be used as a config or a worker, but is counted out just-in-case
# Represents all other physical machines in the cluster

# NOTE: These WILL be different based on the network availability. Configure each node

# control_plane_vip -- IP address that is addressable & available, not overlapping with other clusters, but not pre-allocated. This is created during the process
# ingress_vip: Must be in the Load Balancer pool for the cluster, same rules as control_plane_vip for availability
# load_balancer_pool_cidr: IP addresses for the LoadBalancers (bundled mode) can attach to, same rules as control_plane_vip
# control_plane_ip: -- different than the control_plane_vip, this is the IP of the box you are installing on

# NOTE: In this file, only 9 LBs are allocated per cluster, with 1 taken for Ingress

# Comment out (or remove) any inventory that is not available
