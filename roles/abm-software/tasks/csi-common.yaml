### This file holds common SDS/CSI installation tasks
###
### All SDSs are installed using Cluster Trait Repo concept. CTR is a RootSync object located in a git-repo with the specific configurations
###   of the installation and configuration. CTRs can rely on a GCS bucket for backups and a Google Secret called {{ storage_provider_auth_secret }}
###

###
### 1. If no SDS-specific `git-creds` in k8s, set that up in Google Secrets Manager
### 2. If no GCS bucket for the SDS is created, create a new one
### 3. Apply CTR to cluster
###

###
### At this point, the SDS git-creds should have been created (either via Ansible or outside IaC setup)
###    The GCS bucket for SDS backup should also have been created
